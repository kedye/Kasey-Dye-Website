Teacher usage of Actively Learn\nvaried greatly among schools and content areas. Additionally, the\npercentage of teachers using each feature differed by school and content\narea. Differentiation was the least used feature, while accessibility\nwas the most used feature.\nBackground\nThe 2021-2022 school year was the first year that Actively Learn was\nimplemented in an urban school district’s middle and high schools.\nActively Learn is a digital curriculum platform with content across a\nrange of areas (e.g. English, Social Studies, Science). It includes a\nvariety of ways students and teachers can interact with the platform,\nsuch as reading and annotating articles, commenting on peer comments,\nand looking up words in the built-in dictionary. The school district has\na 5-year contract in place to use Actively Learn.\nData Processing\nThe original data included 740 participants, but some of these\nparticipants were actually school administrators, duplicates, or\ncurriculum specialists. Only participants that had 10 or more students,\nor were special education teachers with at least one student, were\nincluded in this data analysis. This brought the total number of\nparticipants down to 440 teachers.\nI separated teacher content areas into 5 categories: Social Studies,\nELA, Special Education, Science, and Other. Some teachers were already\ncategorized as Other by the Actively Learn system, and I added Math\nteachers and World Language teachers to the Other category as well.\nAnalysis\nData was then analyzed by district-level, content, and school. I\nexamined how many teachers were using Actively Learn, the number of\nteacher logins, the number of active students, and the number of\nassignments. For different features, I categorized teachers as\nusing/encouraging or not using/encouraging each feature. Teachers had to\nuse the feature at least 10 times for them to be categorized as\nusing/encouraging it. This ensured that I were accounting for purposeful\nuse of the feature. The features I examined were:\nDifferentiation (Number of assignments with at least one student\nmarked as ‘Extra Help’)\nAnnotation (Number of notes created by students across all of the\nteacher’s assignments)\nDiscussion (Number of teacher or student notes that have at least\none student reply in the teacher’s assignments)\nAccessibility (Total number of times students used the text to\nspeech and translation features)\nVocabulary (Total number of times students performed word lookups\nin assignments)\nProviding feedback (Number of unique student responses where the\nteacher added a comment)\nTeacher Usage of Actively\nLearn\nDivision-Level\nTeachers Using Actively\nLearn\nThis table shows the mean and median number of teacher logins, number\nof assignments, and active students across the district. The median\nnumber (the middle number when put in numerical order) was included to\naccount for outliers.\n\n\nAcross the District\n    Mean Number of Teacher Logins\n      Median Number of Teacher Logins\n      Mean Number of Total Assignments\n      Median Number of Total Assignments\n      Mean Number of Active Students\n      Median Number of Active Students\n    83\n47\n27\n16\n71\n66\n\nFor all teachers in the district, the mean number of teacher logins\nto Actively Learn for the 2021-2022 school year was 83. The median was\nmuch lower at 47, showing that there are most likely outliers. The mean\nnumber of total assignments per teacher using Actively Learn was 27\n(median was 16), and the mean number of active students per teacher was\n71 (median was 66). However, these numbers vary greatly when looking at\nindividual teachers. I will discuss these differences further into this\nreport.  \nThe graph below shows the number of teachers using Actively Learn and\nwhat subject they teach per school.\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the graph, the majority of teachers using Actively\nLearn taught ELA. Some schools only had one or two different content\nareas using Actively Learn, such as Board High School, Bell Middle\nSchool, and Online School. Other Schools, such as Ocean Middle School,\nhad teachers from all five content areas using Actively Learn. The\nnumber of teachers using Actively Learn at each school varied greatly,\nfrom 2 teachers at Mary High School and Hill High School to 38 teachers\nat Ocean Middle School.\nPercentage\nof Teachers Using Each Feature in the District\nThe table below shows the number of teachers using or encouraging\neach feature within Actively Learn. Features with asterisks (**),\ndifferentiation and feedback, are the features that are initiated by the\nteachers, such as the teacher using the differentiation feature on an\nassignment by marking one or more students as ‘Extra Help.’ Features\nwithout asterisks are the features that are taught and encouraged by the\nteachers and initiated by the students, such as teaching the students\nhow to use the annotation feature and then having them annotate\nassignments.\n\n\nPercentage of Teachers in District Using or Encouraging Each Feature\n    Feature\n      Percentage\n    accessibility\n59%annotation\n28%**differentation\n7%discussion\n39%**feedback\n18%vocabulary\n36%\n\nThe least used/encouraged feature was differentiation, with only 7.3%\nof the teachers in the district using it. A little more than a third of\nall teachers used/encouraged the discussion (at least 1 student replying\nin the assignments) and vocabulary features (using word lookups in\nassignments). More than half, 59%, of all teachers used/encouraged the\naccessibility feature (using text to speech and translation).\nCorrelation Between Features\nThe correlation matrix plot below demonstrates the correlation, how\nrelated two variables are, between each of the features. The closer the\nnumber is to 1, the stronger the correlation is, and numbers close to\nzero indicate no correlation.\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a strong correlation between annotation and\nvocabulary, such that teachers using/encouraging the annotation feature\nare more likely to to have students using the vocabulary (students\nperforming word lookups in assignments) feature. There also appears to\nbe a slight correlation between differentiation and accessibility, such\nthat teachers using the differentiation feature are more likely to have\nstudents using the accessibility (text to speech and translation)\nfeature.\nNo correlation, like between annotation and differentiation, means\nthat teachers that are using/encouraging one feature may not be\nusing/encouraging the other feature.\nSchool\nNumber of\nTeachers Using Actively Learn Per School\nThe graph below shows the number of teachers using Actively Learn at\neach school.\n\n\n\nAs previously demonstrated, the number of teachers using Actively\nLearn at each school varied greatly\nNumber of Teacher Logins\nPer School\nThe graph below shows the number of teacher logins on Actively Learn\nat each school. Each dot represents an individual teacher. The mean\nnumber of teacher logins per school is shown with the black line on the\ngraph.\n\n\n\nMost of the teachers had approximately 80 logins on Actively Learn\nfor the school year. Multiple teachers, however, had more than 400\nlogins on Actively Learn during the school year.\nNumber of Assignments Per\nSchool\nThe graph below shows the number of assignments each teacher gave at\neach school. Each dot represents an individual teacher’s number of\nassignments. The mean number of teacher assignments per school is shown\nwith the black line on the graph.\n\n\n\nMost of the teachers gave approximately 25 assignments on Actively\nLearn for the school year. Multiple teachers frequently used Actively\nLearn and gave more than 100 assignments during the school year.\nHowever, more assignments may not equate to better instruction or best\npractices.\nPercent of\nTeachers Using the Feature At Each School\nThe graph below shows the feature usages per school. Features with\nasterisks (**) are the features that are initiated by the teachers.\nFeatures without asterisks are the features that are taught and\nencouraged by the teachers and initiated by the students.\n\n\n\nAs the graph above indicates, the feature usages at each school also\nvaries greatly. Differentiation is the least used feature across all\nschools. At many schools, the majority of teachers are using/encouraging\nat least one feature consistently. The features that are being\nconsistently used/encouraged at each school differs. For example, at\nSunny Middle School the two features used/encouraged the most were\naccessibility and discussion. Whereas at Bell Middle School, the two\nfeatures used/encouraged the most were accessibility and annotation.\nSome schools, like Hill High School and Mary High School,\nused/encouraged very few features.\n   \nThe graphs below show each individual feature usage per school.\n\n\n\nThe graphs above show that teachers at many schools are not using\ndifferentiation, and teachers at multiple schools are not using the\nfeedback, discussion, and annotation features. Teachers at some schools,\nhowever, are consistently using/encouraging the Actively Learn features.\nFor example, more than half of the teachers at Lillian Middle School,\nHighway Middle School, Online School, and Online Middle School\nused/encouraged the vocabulary feature. Additionally, more than 60% of\nthe teachers at Bell Middle School, Online School, and Breezy High\nSchool used/encouraged the annotation feature.\nContent\nNumber of\nTeachers Using Actively Learn Per Content\nThe graph below demonstrates the content areas for teachers using\nActively Learn.\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of the teachers using Actively Learn teach ELA.\nNumber of Teacher Logins\nPer Content\nThe graph below shows the number of teacher logins on Actively Learn\nfor each content area. Each dot represents an individual teacher. The\nmean number of teacher logins per school is shown with the black line on\nthe graph.\n\n\n\nThe mean number of teacher logins was higher for ELA teachers than\nother content areas. Numerous ELA teachers had more than 200 logins on\nActively Learn, along with a couple Social Studies and Science\nteachers.\nNumber of Assignments Per\nContent\nThe graph below shows the number of assignments each teacher gave by\ntheir content area.\n\n\n\nThe mean number of assignments was highest for ELA and Social Studies\nteachers. One Social Studies teacher gave more than 350 assignments on\nActively Learn during the school year.\nPercent of\nTeachers Using the Feature By Content\nThe graph below shows the feature usages per content area. Features\nwith asterisks (**) are the features that are initiated by the teachers.\nFeatures without asterisks are the features that are taught and\nencouraged by the teachers and initiated by the students.\n\n\n\nSimilar to the feature usages per school, the most commonly used\nfeature was accessibility and the least used feature was differentiation\nacross most of the content areas. For special education teachers,\nhowever, the most commonly used/encouraged feature was discussion, but\noverall special education teachers used/encouraged the least amount of\nfeatures. ELA teachers most consistently used/encouraged features\ncompared to other content area teachers.  \nThe graphs below show each individual feature usage.\n\n\n\nThe graphs above show ELA teachers are consistently using/encouraging\nthe discussion, accessibility, and vocabulary features on Actively\nLearn. The graphs also demonstrate how little the differentiation\nfeature is being used.\nTop Teachers Using the\nFeatures\nI shared a spreadsheet with the top five teachers that used each\nfeature most frequently. District Curriculum Specialists may want to\nconsider asking some of these teachers to lead a professional\ndevelopment session about how they use these features in their\nclassrooms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe 2021-2022 school year was the first year that the school district\nimplemented Actively Learn. Teacher usage of Actively Learn varied\ngreatly among schools and content areas. For the district’s second year\nwith Actively Learn, the District Curriculum Specialists could create\nprofessional development sessions on how to use and teach students to\nuse different features. The differentiation feature was used very little\nthis past year, so additional training on this feature could increase\nusage. I recommend additional student data be collected during the\nsecond and third years of implementing Actively Learn so that student\ngrowth and achievement can be analyzed.\n\n\n\n",
