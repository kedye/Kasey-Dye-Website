      "contents": "\n\nI am currently a third year doctoral student in the Special Education and Disability Policy program at Virginia Commonwealth University. For my dissertation, I am interested in investigating barriers and supports to healthcare access for children with disabilities.\nI enjoy completing program evaluations to help school districts and organizations determine participant satisfaction, knowledge gained, and ideas for improvement. During the past two summers, I worked for the Metropolitan Educational Research Consortium (MERC) to complete a program evaluation of the Petersburg Partnership Program.\nI plan to complete my PhD in Spring/Summer of 2023 and begin my career as a data analyst.\n\n\n\n",
