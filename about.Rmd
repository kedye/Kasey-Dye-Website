I completed my PhD at Virginia Commonwealth University in May 2023. For my dissertation, I analyzed health insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs for children with special healthcare needs. Using a large national data set, I conducted logistic regressions and multilevel modeling to answer my research questions.

I enjoy completing program evaluations to help school districts and organizations determine participant satisfaction, knowledge gained, and ideas for improvement. During the past two summers, I worked for the Metropolitan Educational Research Consortium (MERC) to complete a program evaluation of the Petersburg Partnership Program.
